## File Naming Convention

Before submitting your task, please make sure you've named your directory or file according to this convention.
The name is divided into 3 sections:
- **w1**: The first section is used to say the week of the jobsheet. For example, `w1` means week 1, `w2` means week 2, so on and so forth.
- **your_name**: The second section is used for your name, obviously. Make sure they're all in lowercased letter with spaces replaced with underscore. Remove punctuation if any.
- **topic**: The third section is used for the topic of the jobsheet. It has the same rule as the second section.

A full example would look like this:
```
w2-baihaqi_aulia_asyari-class_and_objects
```

## Do's and Don'ts

- Please don't commit directly to the `main` branch because you're more likely to override other people's work. Nobody wants that
- Please submit all your jobsheets as a Pull Request with the appropriate title to avoid confusion.
